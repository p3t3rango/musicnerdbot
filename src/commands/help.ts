Here's how to use my features:

**Commands:**
â€¢ \`/link\` - Connect your Spotify account
â€¢ \`/track\` - Get commentary on your current track
â€¢ \`/history\` - Get commentary on your recently played tracks
â€¢ \`/taste\` - Get an analysis of your music taste

**Mentions:**
You can also mention me (@MusicNerdCarl) in any message to get commentary on your current track!

**Tips:**
â€¢ Make sure you're playing music on Spotify when using commands
â€¢ Use \`/link\` first to connect your Spotify account
â€¢ Ask "worth it?" after any response to get my rating
